# HTGAA
How to Grow (Almost) Anything

The purpose of this repository is to store a curated version of all protocols during the HTGAA course.
That include past protocols, and current lab protocols. These protocols will contain both the manual lab protocols and- when available to Roboton automated version of the protocols.

It can be unit-tested at https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Suvin-Sundararajan/HTGAA/blob/main/labprotocols.html
